# Recurrent Autoencoder for Music Generation

## Setup and Installation

1. All dependencies were installed using the `conda` package manager from the Anaconda distribution of Python (available for download [here](https://www.anaconda.com/))
2. Once Anaconda is installed, create a virtual environment
   `conda create -n myenvname`
3. Install the remaining packages for the neural network, jupyter notebook frontend, music21 for generating MIDIs, and numpy for data wrangling.
   1. `conda install -c anaconda keras`
   2. `conda install jupyter`
   3. `conda install -c iainsgillis music21`
   4. `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
4. Lastly, to view the music generated by the network `music21.stream.Stream` objects have a `.show()` method; however, this method does not always work. To reliably view the sheet music of midis, I suggest using the free music notation software Musescore (available for download [here](https://musescore.org/en)).
